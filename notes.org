* RoadMap Classical content
** Introduction
- Aims
  - Attracting new teams (newcomers to robotics and well-known research labs)
    - Gameplay has to be interesting
    - More representation in conferences/workshop
  - Increasing representation of Humanoid league in research community
  - Encourage variety
- Changes organization:
  - Changes:
    - Event-driven changes
    - Rule submission changes
  - Type of change impacts delay of announcement
    - 6M change -> Gameplay change, no impact on robot design or fields
    - 2Y change -> Serious impact for LOC and/or team
    - 5Y change -> Major impact on design of robots
- Survey of current level
  - Aim
    - Allow event-driven roadmap
    - Monitor leagues improvements
  - Stored elements
    - Belief of robots (loc/opponents/ball, with uncertainty)
    - Measured positions (external cameras)
** Scientific problematics
- Motion control
  - Locomotion
    - Difficult grounds
      - Artificial turf
      - Real grass (risk of mud etc...)
    - Energy efficiency
  - Stable highly dynamic motions
    - E.g Kick
  - Task-driven dynamic locomotion
    - Change of gaits
    - Transition between motion
  - Safely falling (for robot And human)
  - Safe motions (no risk for other robots)
- Perception
  - Away from color-encoded environment
  - Dynamic
  - Embedded
  - Outdoor
- Decision-making
  - Partial information
  - Noisy information
  - Incomplete/learned model
- Interaction with humans
  - Safety at playing with humans?
** Short-term RoadMap
*** 2019
**** Competition
- Adult size: 2P, 14.5 * 9m
- Throw-in and corners: played autonomously as free kicks
- Robustness: robots can only enter during stoppage of game
**** Technical challenges
- No changes?
*** 2020
**** Games
- ...
**** Technical challenges
- ...
** Game RoadMap
*** Leagues management
- Division A / Division B
- Freestyle League?
- Conditions for discontinuing league
  - Number of teams registered?
  - Compatibility
*** Field evolutions
- Dimensions
  - Important aspects
    - Moving speed
    - Kick power
    - Kick accuracy (size of the goal with respect to field)
  - Number players related to size
- Outdoor
  - 5Y Without rain
    - Organization option: Game fields outside, Game fields inside
    - Triggered when: field too big
  - 5Y With rain
- Real grass / field
*** Gameplay
- Extending Duration:
  - Based on what events
- Autonomous robots
  - Removing handlers in adult-size <- Require fall impact success
  - Removing WiFi
- Robustness
  - Removing all pick-ups
- Offences
  - Adding offsides
    - Based on localization skill
  - Which behaviors are accepted
    - Mandatory to avoid 'failed' kicks before playing vs humans
** Technical challenges RoadMap
*** Static ball kick
- High kick
- Accurate kick from moving robot
  - Robots move toward the ball and kicks toward a small goal
  - Motivation:
    - Transition between motions
*** Dynamic ball kick
- Kick from moving ball
- Volley Kick
  - Dynamic motion
- Aerial Kick
*** Dexterity
- Dribbling (ball control)
- Juggling
- Grasping the ball (human-like hands)
*** Robustness
- Push-Up recovery
- Reducing fall impact
  - Minimizing max-force measured by pressure sensor (with respect to initial energy)
*** Misc
- Jump

 
** Demos RoadMap
- Aim:
  - Provide opportunity to display unusual behaviors in less competitive context
- Example
  - Autonomous robot vs manually controled robots
  - Robots and handlers playing together (only robots are allowed to score)
  - ...
** RoadMap updates and maintenance
- Update every 1/2 year
- Expiration date: 5 years
  - Motivation: update scientific problematics
** Related technologies
* Critical path
- To be written
