* RoadMap Classical content
** Introduction
- Aims
  - Attracting new teams (newcomers to robotics and well-known research labs)
    - Gameplay has to be interesting
    - More representation in conferences/workshop
  - Increasing representation of Humanoid league in research community
  - Encourage variety
- Changes organization:
  - Changes:
    - Event-driven changes
    - Rule submission changes
  - Type of change impacts delay of announcement
    - 1Y change -> Minor impact for a
    - 2Y change -> Serious impact for LOC and/or team
    - 5Y change -> Major impact on design of robots
** Scientific problematics
- Motion control
  - Ground type
    - Artificial turf
    - Real grass (risk of mud etc...)
  - Task-driven dynamic locomotion
  - Safely falling
- Perception
  - Color-encoded environment
- Decision-making
- Interaction with humans
** RoadMap
*** Leagues management
- Division A / Division B
- Freestyle League?
- Conditions for discontinuing league
  - Number of teams registered?
  - Compatibility
*** Field evolutions
- Dimensions
  - Important aspects
    - Moving speed
    - Kick power
    - Kick accuracy (size of the goal with respect to field)
- Outdoor
- Real grass / field 

** RoadMap updates and maintenance
- Update every 1/2 year
- Expiration date: 5 years
  - Motivation: update scientific problematics
** Related technologies
