\section{Introduction}

% Document: proposal to replace 2014 version: main issues identified
% - Difficult to plan long-term evolution in research -> guided by breakthrough
% - Example of kid-size
This document is a proposal to replace the roadmap proposed in 2014 for the
RoboCup humanoid
league~\footnote{\url{http://www.robocuphumanoid.org/wp-content/uploads/HumanoidLeagueProposedRoadmap.pdf}}. Criticism
have emerged with respect to establishing a long-term schedule for evolution of
the rules in a research context where evolution is mainly guided by breakthrough
rather than by linear development. Some of the changes planned revealed to be
difficult to implement: the removal of the KidSize initially planned for 2020
seems now unrealistic since this league still received more applications than
TeenSize and AdultSize together in 2019. Finally, the relationship between
missing skills and research topics was not explicited.

% Aim of this document + events to gather opinions
In order to avoid facing this issues, a different approach is used. Rather than
establishing a long-term schedule, the document describes the targeted challenge
for the league, the steps required to tackle it. Upcoming changes in the next 5
years are described in more detail to allow teams to plan their developments. In
order to produce a roadmap satisfying for both the trustees and the league, a
workshop was run at IROS2018 and polls have been proposed to both of them. While
a consensus was obtained on most of the questions, this process has also shown
that for some propositions it is difficult to reach an agreement.

\subsection{Goals of the roadmap}

\subsection{Which path to follow?}
% First focus toward improving gameplay

\subsection{Structure of the document}

The structure of the documents is as
follows. Section~\ref{sec:ScientificProblematics} introduces the scientific
challenges related to the league and their importance in the games. The major
upcoming changes to the rules are presented in Section~\ref{sec:ShortTerm}. The
global evolution of the leagues is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:LongTerm}
through an event-triggered Roadmap and the history of changes which occured
since the creation of the league.

\section{Evolution of the document}

\begin{itemize}
\item Status of the 'long-term' part updated yearly to assess progress
\item Status of the 'short-term' part updated every year or every two years
\item Scientific problematics: updated every 5 years
